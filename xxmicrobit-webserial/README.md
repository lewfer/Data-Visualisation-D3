# Code Lab: Getting Started with Web Serial

For complete instructions, see the [Web Serial code lab][codelab]

## What you’ll build

In this codelab, you'll build a web page that uses Web Serial interacts with
a micro:bit board to show different images on its 5x5 LED matrix. You'll learn
about Web Serial, and how to use Readable, Writeable, and Transform Streams
to communicate with serial devices in the browser.

## What you’ll learn

* How to open and close a Web Serial port
* How to use a read loop to handle data from an input stream
* How to send data out via a write stream

## What you’ll need

* A [BBC micro:bit board](https://microbit.org/) with the latest
  [Espruino firmware](https://www.espruino.com/Download#microbit)
* A recent version of Chrome (78 or later)
* Knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Chrome DevTools.

We chose to use the micro:bit for this codelab because it’s easily affordable,
offers a few inputs (buttons) and outputs (5x5 LED display), and can also
provide additional inputs and outputs. See
[BBC micro:bit](https://www.espruino.com/MicroBit) page on the Espruino site
for details on what the micro:bit is capable of.
